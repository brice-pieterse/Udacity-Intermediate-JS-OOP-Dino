# Dino Info - OOP Programming Project from Udacity's Intermediate JavaScript Nanodegree

## Description

The project compares a human's (user) height (in imperial or metric units), weight, and diet to a selection of dino facts.

The main objective is to extend my understanding of the different ways objects can be created, their advantages and drawbacks, while gaining experience with the DOM.

## Using the app

Enter your name, height, weight and diet type (herbivore, omnivore or carnivore). Use the Units radio buttons to choose metric (cm, kg) or imperial units (feet/inches, lbs) for height and weight.

When you are finished entering the data, press the Compare Me! button to see yourself compared to dinosaurs, and a modern-day friend.

If you want to try again, you may click the Go Again button.
